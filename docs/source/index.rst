Welcome to PCA Geospatial Data documentation!
===================================

This documentation is intended to offer support on the different innovations introduced by the **PCA Geospatial Data Department** making available quick access to guides, tutorials (and video tutorials!!!).

.. attention::

   This documentation is currently under active development and some sections are to be considered not stable.

The documentation is constantly updated and it can be viewed online or downloaded in PDF format (see below).

The choice of a ReadtheDocs documentation format has been dictated by the intention to offer a *simple* and *intuitive* interface, which guarantees a collaborative space where everyone can add information and correct possible errors.

If you are new to this documentation, the table of contents below and in the sidebar should let you easily access the documentation for your topic of interest. You can also use the search function in the top left corner

Besides the online access to this documentation, this pages can be downloaded for offline reading. They are accessible from the
:guilabel:`Read the Docs` menu at the bottom of the sidebar, as:

* HTML zipped files that you can extract and :ref:`use as paths <doc_config_path>`
  from within the software
* PDF files

.. note:: The documentation is constantly updated and new sections are added frequently.
   Requests for new sections and guides are welcome, as is your feedback. If something isn't clear enough, or you can't find what you're looking
   for in the docs, help us improve the docs by letting us know.
