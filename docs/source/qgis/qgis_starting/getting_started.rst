This chapter provides a quick overview of installing and configuring QGIS. 

On any PCA workstation, you will find an updated version of QGIS (if you need to install the software on a new computer, you can refer to our IT department or to our Geospatial Data department for support).

Whether you are using a pre-installed version of QGIS or you are installing a new version from scratch, it is very important to know how QGIS versions work. 

QGIS is a very prolific software with frequent updates and new version releases (every 4 months). This allows the developers to provide the community with constant support, both introducing new features and fixing in short time bugs and issues. 

This means that in a single year, 5 different versions of QGIS are available for download, but only one of them will be labelled as LTR (Longe Term Release), which is the suggested version for business use and that guarantees a longer continuity of features and tools along all the year, without big changes.

Furthermore, PCA's current QGIS workflow makes extensive use of add-ons and plugins specifically developed for our integrated DRS/GIS system.
For the functionality of each plugin to be guaranteed, it is important that all workstations use a version of QGIS previously tested by the Geospatial data department.

For these reasons, it is very important that all the workstations are using the same QGIS LTR version and that each update is previously authorized by the geospatial data team.

Currently the version used is the  :guilabel:`3.22.10-1` (that it will be soon replaced by the 3.28.7) 



Installing QGIS
===============

As just described, several versions of QGIS exist at the same time and, often, the version currently chosen as the one to be used in our company is no longer among the versions available for download on the official software site.

On the understanding that the management of QGIS versions in corporate workstations is the responsibility of IT departments or geospatial data, to which reference can be made for any request for help, if, for a specific reason, you need to install a copy of QGIS in your own workstation, you can access to the current installation files in our server at the address *Z:\\GeoSpatialData_Resources\\QGIS_Resources\\Current_QGIS_Installer*

Suggested basic interface configuration



Here are some examples of GUI labels:

- Buttons: :guilabel:`Save`, :guilabel:`Cancel`, :guilabel:`OK`
- Dropdown menus: :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`Edit`, :guilabel:`View`
- Checkboxes: :guilabel:`Enable auto-save`, :guilabel:`Remember me`
- Radio buttons: :guilabel:`Male`, :guilabel:`Female`, :guilabel:`Other`
- Input fields: :guilabel:`Enter your name`, :guilabel:`Search for a term`
- Progress bars: :guilabel:`Loading...`, :guilabel:`Uploading...`

You can use these GUI label directives in your documentation to indicate the names of buttons, menus, fields, and other user interface elements. This helps to make your documentation more user-friendly and easier to follow for readers who may not be familiar with the interface.

Note that you can also customize the appearance of GUI labels using CSS, if desired.
