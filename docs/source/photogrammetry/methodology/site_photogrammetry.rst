# Site Photogrammetry
===================

.. note:: 
    This chapter focuses on the process of recording photogrammetry on-site.
    

Preparing for Photography
-------------------------

1. Before taking photos, ensure you have the following equipment ready: 
    * Photogrammetry sheet
    * Suitable camera
    * GPS device
    * Targets (Agisoft or others)
    * Small nails
    
2. Clean and expose the subject or feature you are photographing.
    This will ensure a more accurate depiction.
    
3. Arrange your targets in a box shape around the feature.
    Each target should be placed no more than a meter from the previous one, in a straight line. Nail the targets into the ground at the corners, taking care not to damage the targets themselves.
    
4. Complete your photogrammetry sheet.
    A completed sheet should resemble this example. Here, the subject is a skeleton with six targets sketched around it, each target numbered.
.. note::
    When filling out the photo numbers, wait until you've finished photographing, then write the final number onto the sheet.

Taking photos
-------------

5. Begin by photographing your photogrammetry sheet.
    Ensure all information is correctly filled out.

6. Starting from one end of your feature, take photos at a standing height, rotating around the feature and taking a photo at each shoulder step.
    Ensure the feature is centered in each photo.

7. Repeat step 6 from a crouched height.
    You should complete two full circles around the subject at different heights.

8. Next, take plan shots of the subject, starting from one end and moving forward a step with each photo to cover the subject from top to bottom.
    Repeat this process, starting from the same end, until the subject is thoroughly covered by photos.

.. note::
    For example, with a skeleton, start from the feet and move up the body, taking plan shots. Repeat this three times to cover the right, center, and left sides of the body, starting from the feet each time.
    
9. Then, take plan shots from the other direction (moving left to right) until the subject is completely covered by photos.
    Steps 8 and 9 together should create a crosshatch pattern, forming a mosaic of plan photos of the subject.

10. Now take close-up photos of the subject. Repeat steps 8 and 9 with close-up images.
	This will help produce higher detail images and 3D models.

11. Once satisfied, photograph the targets surrounding your subject. Take one zoomed-out and one zoomed-in photo of each target, resulting in two photos per target.

12. Conclude by taking a final photo of your photogrammetry sheet.
