Preparing for photography
-------------------------

1. Before taking photos make sure you have the following equipment: 
	* Photogrammetry sheet
	* A suitable camera
	* GPS
	* Targets (agisoft or otherwise)
	* Small nails
	
2. When the feature/object is cleaned and exposed to a suitable standard. Place your targets in a box shape around the feature you are taking photographs of.
	Each target should be placed no more than a metre from the previous target and be in-line. Each traget should be nailed into the ground at the corners, avoiding any damage to the image of the target itself.
