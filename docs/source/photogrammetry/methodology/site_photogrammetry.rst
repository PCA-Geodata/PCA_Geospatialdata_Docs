Site photogrammetry
===================

.. note:: 
	This chapter focuses on the process of recording photogrammetry whilst on site.
	

Preparing for photography
-------------------------

1. Before taking photos make sure you have the following equipment: 
	* Photogrammetry sheet
	* A suitable camera
	* GPS
	* Targets (agisoft or otherwise)
	* Small nails
	
2. Clean and expose the object/feature you're photographing.
	This will ensure a more accuracte depiciton
	
3. Place your targets in a box shape around the feature you are taking photographing.
	Each target should be placed no more than a metre from the previous target and be in-line. Nail the targets into the ground at the corners, avoiding any damage to the image of the target itself.
	
4. Complete your photogrammetry sheet. 
	A completed sheet should look something like this. In this example the object is a skeleton with 6 targets sketched around it, displaying the number of each target. 
.. note::
	When filling out photo numbers, wait until you've finished photgraphing and then write the final number onto the sheet.

Taking photos
--------------

5. Start by taking a photo of your photogrammetry sheet.

6. Starting from one end of your feature, at a standing height, rotate around your feature taking a photo every shoulder step. 
	Try to make sure the feature your photographing is central of each photo.
	
7. Repeat step 6 but taking photos from a crouched height.
