Site photogrammetry
===================

.. note:: 
	This chapter focuses on the process of recording photogrammetry whilst on site.
	

Preparing for photography
-------------------------

1. Before taking photos make sure you have the following equipment: 
	* Photogrammetry sheet
	* A suitable camera
	* GPS
	* Targets (agisoft or otherwise)
	* Small nails
	
2. Clean and expose the subject/feature you're photographing.
	This will ensure a more accuracte depiciton
	
3. Place your targets in a box shape around the feature you are taking photographing.
	Each target should be placed no more than a metre from the previous target and be in-line. Nail the targets into the ground at the corners, avoiding any damage to the image of the target itself.
	
4. Complete your photogrammetry sheet. 
	A completed sheet should look something like this. In this example the subject is a skeleton with 6 targets sketched around it, displaying the number of each target. 
.. note::
	When filling out photo numbers, wait until you've finished photgraphing and then write the final number onto the sheet.

Taking photos
--------------

5. Start by taking a photo of your photogrammetry sheet.
	Make sure information is correctly filled out.

6. Starting from one end of your feature, at a standing height, rotate around your feature taking a photo every shoulder step. 
	Try to make sure the feature your photographing is central of each photo.

7. Repeat step 6 but taking photos from a crouched height.
	So you end up doing two full circles of the subject at two different heights.

8. Now starting from one end of your feature, begin to take plan shots of the subject. Moving forward a step with each photo so you cover it top to bottom.
	Repeat this step, starting from the same end until your subject has been covered by enough photos.

.. note::
	In the example of the skeleton, starting from the feet move up the body taking plan shots. Repeating this 3 times to cover the right, center and left side of the body. Starting from the feet each time.
	
9. Now take plan shots in the other direction (moving left to right) until the subject has been covered by enough photos.
	Steps 8 and 9 in combination should create a crosshatch pattern, creating a mosaic of plan photos of the subject.

10. At this point, you now want close-up photos of the subject. Repeating steps 8 and 9 but with close up images. 
	This will help produced higher detail images/3d models.
	
11. Once you are satisfied, take photos of the targets surrounding your subject. One zoomed out and another zoomed in. So two photos of each target.


12. Finalise by taking photo of your photogrammetry sheet.
