Installation
------------

The Mergin mobile app is part of the DRS/GIS integrated system. 

It allows us to visualise and interrogate on mobiles (phones and tablets) the GIS interactive site plans, where both survey data and DRS data are stored and integrated. 

In simplest words, it can be considered a valid alternative to a Webmap system and, unlike this, it also allows us to edit site plans and DRS data on mobile devices.
